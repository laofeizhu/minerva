# Minerva ðŸ§ 

A memory-based assistant inspired by human memory mechanisms.

## Current Status: Hello World Implementation

This repository contains the foundational structure for Minerva, currently implemented as a hello world to establish the basic project framework.

## What is Minerva?

Minerva aims to be an AI assistant that learns and remembers like humans do - through associative memory networks, consolidation processes, and intelligent retrieval. Unlike traditional AI that starts fresh each time, Minerva will build persistent, interconnected memories that get smarter with use.

## Hello World Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Say hello
uv run minerva hello

# Show system info
uv run minerva info
```

## Vision

The goal is to create a memory system that:
- ðŸ§  **Learns from every interaction** through universal memory mechanisms
- ðŸ”— **Builds associative networks** connecting related experiences
- ðŸŒ™ **Consolidates memories** during "sleep" cycles to extract patterns
- ðŸŽ¯ **Applies learned patterns** to new situations intelligently

## Next Steps

The design documents are being refined to focus on:
1. **Universal memory mechanisms** (not domain-specific)
2. **Associative networks** for natural memory connections
3. **Consolidation processes** for pattern extraction and learning
4. **Intelligent retrieval** based on context and associations

## Contributing

This project emphasizes:
- **Simplicity first** - Start with hello world, build incrementally
- **Universal mechanisms** - Avoid over-specialization
- **Human-inspired design** - Learn from neuroscience and psychology
- **Step-by-step development** - Each milestone adds clear value
