# Minerva

The goal of the Minerva project is to create a LLM based agent which can learn, remember and form memory like a human.

We will start with the biological memory mechanism like human, and develop necessary components to support human-like memory.

## Devlopment Principles

1. Simplicity - do never complicate things. Complication is the killer for a good project. The development quality and correctness of the code will drop rapidly when the codebase becomes too complex.

2. Step by step - do never make ambitious goals or milestones, instead, let's breakdown the goals into little visible improvements.
