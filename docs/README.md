# Minerva Documentation

The goal of the Minerva project is to create an AI assistant that learns, remembers, and forms memories like a human through **universal memory mechanisms**.

## Core Philosophy

Minerva is inspired by human memory systems but focuses on **universal mechanisms** rather than domain-specific implementations. The key insight is that human memory doesn't have separate systems for different types of experiences - it uses the same fundamental mechanisms for all learning.

## Development Principles

1. **Simplicity** - Never complicate things. Complexity kills projects. Keep mechanisms simple and universal.

2. **Step by step** - Never make ambitious goals. Break everything into small, visible improvements.

3. **Universality** - Avoid over-specialization. Design mechanisms that work for any type of memory or learning.

4. **Human-inspired** - Learn from neuroscience and psychology, but adapt for computational implementation.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Design
- **[design_v2.md](design_v2.md)** - Universal memory mechanism architecture (current)
- **[computer_memory.md](computer_memory.md)** - Original detailed design (legacy)
- **[human_memory.md](human_memory.md)** - Biological memory research foundation

### Implementation
- **[execution.md](execution.md)** - Development milestones and roadmap
- **[workflow.md](workflow.md)** - Detailed implementation workflow
- **[quickstart_with_uv.md](quickstart_with_uv.md)** - Setup and development guide

### Examples and Use Cases
- **[usecases.md](usecases.md)** - Example scenarios and workflows
- **[coding_memory_design.md](coding_memory_design.md)** - Programming-specific design (legacy)

## Current Status

**Phase**: Hello World Implementation
**Focus**: Universal memory mechanisms
**Next**: Basic memory storage with associative networks

The project has been refactored to focus on universal, human-inspired memory mechanisms rather than domain-specific implementations.
